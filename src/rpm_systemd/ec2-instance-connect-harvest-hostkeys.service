# Prefixing the ExecStart executable with a '-' ignores any failure exit codes and considers it a success
# This is to avoid issues with the host key harvesting script during system startup
# and not leave the system in a degraded state.
# See Table 1 under ExecStart= for details https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html
